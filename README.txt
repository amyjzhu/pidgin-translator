This is a release of Harvard's Pidgin tool, which uses program dependence graphs to explore and enforce information security guarantees in Java applications.

The tool is in two components. The first component (in the directory accrue-bytecode/) produces a whole-program dependence graph, and outputs this graph as a gzipped JSON file. The second component (in the directory pidgin/) allows interactive and batch querying of the whole-program dependence graphs.

See the file hello_world.txt for additional information on how to try out the tool.
